# Train Image Classifier Using Active Learning

*Comment* Why use active learning, active learning's slow computation on
raw images, package uses Norouzaddeh's approach in their paper, it was
adapted from the code that they used in their paper so that it can be
used outside of an experiment. It provides a main script "run_active_learning"
for running active learning but it also provides the objects, active_learning_environment,
data_set and engine which users can use for building their own image processing model.
It also uses both timelapse and AL algorithms designed by Google.

## Quick start

*Comment* What you need to run the program, the code that you need to run, 
how to prepare the data, how to label
things with timelapse. Using logging package to see info messages

## Training Algorithm

*Comment* Parameters of main script (No elaboration as that comes later), choices for training algorithm,
I think that when I elaborate, I should use pandas' example of have the parameter and then talk
about it?

### Data

*Comment* Format of data folders, train set needs all labels, unlabelled needs to be
in subfolders, validation set of classes can be a subset of the training ones

### Active Learning

*Comment* AL batch size, available sampling methods

### Embedding model

*Comment* Available architectures, triplet loss vs softmax, 
(I don't know what the triplet loss hyperparameters do)

### Train and finetune embedding

*Comment* Adam sampler, available hyperparameters, importance of num_epochs, balanced vs simple loader

### Classifier

*Comment* No way to edit classifier as it's hardcoded into the source code :(

## Working folder

This is where all files generated by the package are
saved

### Checkpoint folders

Needed for checkpoints, don't change or move these
folders if you want to load from checkpoint

### label bin

Covered by previous section but described here for completion

### Validation results

Stored in test results folder, to save model for
latest test results, you'll have to copy the export
folder before you submit the labels for that AL batch,
Does not exist if validation doesn't exist

### Exporting model

Trained model for latest test results
