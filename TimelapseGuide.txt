Timelapse is a GUI that allows users to process and label images or video. Timelapse also allows users to review image recognition and classification with [Microsoft Megadetector](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md).  
### Installation Timelapse
Installation link: [Timelapse: Download and Installation](https://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapsse/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Download2)

### Timelapse Template
After installation, you need to first create a Timelapse Template before labelling the photos.
#### Steps to create a Timelapse Template
1. Open **“Timelapse2TemplateEditor”** in Timelapse file
2. Click **“File”** and **“New template…”** to create the template.
3. _Save your template in the folder for unlabelled data and not in any subfolders of it._ 
4. Click **"Choice"** under Add and change Label to Species.
   - Click on Define list to add the species you want to label. 
   - You can also add other labels such as "Count", which allows you to count how many animsals are present in the image.
     However, this will not be used by the package.
5. Quit Timelapse Template Editor after you finish editing, the template will save automatically after you close the window.
### Timelapse 
 After you created the template, you are now able to label your images/videos using Timelapse.
1. Open **"Timelapse2"** in Timelapse file.
2. Click **"File template"** and **"Load template, images, and video files..."** to open the template you created.
   - To review the results of Megadetector, you can click **"Recognition"** and import the output from Megadetector (JSON file).
3. Label the images and review the data from the **"Data Table"** tab.
4. After labeling all the images, click **"File"** and export the data to a CSV file.
